    Concepts Covered- 
        ✅ Calss Design
                __init__ vs class body
                Instance variables vs class variables
                self (what it actually is)
                Object lifecycle

        ✅ Encapsulation (Real Meaning)
            
        ✅ Composition
                “Has-a” vs “Is-a”
                Why ETL systems use composition

        ✅ Inheritance
                Base class
                Method overriding
                super()
                MRO

       
    Problems Solved:
        ✅ Problem 1 — Build a Mini ETL Framework (Composition Required)
            Design a small ETL pipeline with:
                Extractor
                Transformer
                Loader
        ✅ Problem 2 — Encapsulation Enforcement
            Create a simple class handling back operations
                deposit()
                withdraw()
                get_balance()

            Rules:
                Cannot modify balance directly
                Cannot withdraw more than available
                Log transactions
        ✅ Problem 3 — Refactor for Single Responsibility
                Take your current CSVReader - 
                Refactor so each class does ONE thing only.
                    Create at least:
                        Reader
                        Logger
                        Validator (even simple one)
