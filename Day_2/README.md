Day-2:
    Date: 26/JAN/2026
    Phase:0

    Concepts Covered- 
        ✅ Function Design
                Parameters vs arguments
                Positional vs keyword arguments
                Default arguments (⚠️ mutable default trap)
                Return values vs side effects
                Pure vs impure functions
        ✅ Error Handling
                try / except / else / finally
                Catching specific exceptions
                When to re-raise vs handle
                raise vs logging.exception
        ✅ Itteration Patterns
                enumerate
                zip
                Loop + condition + break
                Early exit patterns

    Problems Solved(Same as Day-1 but by retruning each result):
        ✅ LIST PROBLEMS
        Remove duplicates from a list
        Find the second largest number
        Reverse a list without slicing
        Rotate a list k times
        Flatten a nested list

        ✅ SET PROBLEMS
        Find common elements between two lists
        Find elements present in only one list
        Check if one list is a subset of another

        ✅ DICTIONARY PROBLEMS
        Count frequency of elements
        Find first non-repeating element
        Group elements by frequency
        Merge two dictionaries (sum values if keys overlap)
